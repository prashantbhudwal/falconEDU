## On Worksheet Generator
- Our job is to design an application that allows teachers to use AI, to generate a worksheet.
- A worksheet is essentially a set of questions.
- The questions in a worksheet are mostly divided into different sections.
- Each section, on a mechanical level, has just one TYPE of question.
- In this context a TYPE is a way in which a question extracts information from a student.
- But each question type can be used to extract different levels or types of information from a student.
- So, each question type, can be of different types
  - A fill in the blank question can be of different types of fill-in-the blanks
  - Each topic is essentially related to a few specific types of a type of question.
- I can ask GPT to recommend the types of types of questions in a particular context.
- Then I can ask the teacher to choose from those recommendations.
- Then I can ask teacher for number of questions they want.
- Then GPT will give them the question of a particular type in a particular type.
