# Teaching Agent Architecture (WIP)

1. Each teaching agent has objectives.
   1. Long Term Objectives: These are general objectives of the agent. Like "Teach students Mathematics".
   2. Short Term Objectives
      1. These Might be specific to the student. Like "Teach student Algebra".
      2. These might also be specific to the type of task the agent is performing. For example, sometimes the agent might be teaching a student, sometimes it might be assessing a student, sometimes it might be learning from a student, etc.
      3. These might also be specific to the context. For example, the agent might be teaching a student in a classroom, or in a one-on-one session, or in a group session, etc.
2. Each teaching agent has a set of actions it can perform.
3. Each agent has a memory.
   1. This includes a short term memory and a long term memory.
4. Each agent understands the concept of source of truth.
   1. The source of truth is the subject matter knowlege that the agent has to teach.
