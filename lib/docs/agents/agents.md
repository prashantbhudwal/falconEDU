# Building a Fully Autonomous AI Teachers

To build a fully autonomous AI teacher, one must first understand what the teachers do, and then automate each of these actions one by one. For this purpose we must know all the actions that a teacher performs in context of being a teacher.

A fully autonomous AI teacher must be able to do the following:

### Level 0:

- Speak to the student in an empathetic voice
- Understand the student's voice and emotions
- See the students work - text, diagrams, and handwriting

### Level 1:

- Transfer knowledge to students who are willing to learn.
- Assess students and provide feedback
- Escalate to humans when necessary.
- Should be integrated with the school's curriculum.

### Level 2:

- Motivate students to learn
